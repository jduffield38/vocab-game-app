I made some changes to my html and javascript code. Do I need to re-run the Capacitor steps?EditNo, you don't need to re-run all the Capacitor setup! Since the basic structure is already there, you just need to update your files and sync. Here's what to do:

Step 1: Update Your Files
bash
# Copy your updated HTML to the www directory (where Capacitor looks for web files)
bash
cp index.html www/
cp *.css www/ 2>/dev/null || true
cp *.js www/ 2>/dev/null || true
cp *.json www/ 2>/dev/null || true
cp *.png www/ 2>/dev/null || true

# Step 2: Sync to Mobile Projects
bash
npx cap sync

# This updates both your Android and iOS projects with the latest web files.
# Step 3: Commit and Push to GitHub

git add .
git commit -m "Update game with latest code improvements"
git push

Step 4: Build in Appflow

Go to Appflow
Create new build
Select your newest commit
Build for Android and/or iOS

That's It!
